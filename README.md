# Automated-Website
A car lot website that auto updates using Frazer's built in uploads.

Frazer (car dealership software) uploads car informations as well as pictures every day through ftp. I used windows built in Internet Information Service (IIS) to recieve the data
through ftp. 
The images are run through a Python script which resizes them to decrease bandwidth usage.
